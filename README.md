Things to do for swam game  need portals. Lots of portals. Ill do that is I have already done it in 2d so need to transfer it to 3d. Needs particle systems too    needs a save system

Needs a win state  needs a lose state.
  notes on the high def render pipeline  slack notifications (and probably other things going on in the computer too) tend to tank frame rates

Fustrum culling  doesn’t stop because you can’t see the item but the bounds (ie in a tunnel)

Average frame rate on this Mac (with a radon 500 I think) seems to be around the 70 to 80 mark. How ever, when the camera needs to render a load of objects, this tanks to around 35 to 45. L.O.D’s will probably need to be added/implemeted etc  multiple scene loading has no effect on performance what so ever, just makes it much easier to manage the projects and scenes

I don’t think the main project will have much in the way of complex instructions (ie Nav mesh agents). Lets also see what performance I can eek out by adding more lights and baking static light maps
